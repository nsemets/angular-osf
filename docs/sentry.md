# Sentry error filtering

Sentry collects JavaScript errors from the OSF Angular app in the browser. Many of those events are not application bugs: flaky networks, cancelled requests, missing/deleted API resources, browser extensions, and stale tabs after a deploy.

Filtering happens on the client when Sentry starts. Change the lists in `src/app/core/helpers/sentry-filter.helper.ts`. That file is passed into `Sentry.init` from `src/app/core/provider/application.initialization.provider.ts`.

## How to read Sentry after this

If an issue disappears from Sentry, it was probably filtered here. It does not mean the user stopped hitting the error.

Server failures (HTTP 500–599) and real JavaScript exceptions are still sent.

## What we drop

Three independent checks. An event is dropped if **any** of them match.

### 1. Error message (`ignoreErrors`)

Sentry treats each string as a **substring**. `Failed to fetch` also matches `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`.

| AbortError / The operation was aborted / The user aborted a request                                                                                                  | Request cancelled (navigation, timeout, user abort)                                   |

### 2. Script URL (`denyUrls`)

Errors whose stack frames come from a **browser extension**, not from OSF code (`chrome-extension://`, `moz-extension://`, `safari-extension://`, and similar).

### 3. HTTP status below 500 (`beforeSend`)

If the event is an HTTP response (Angular `HttpErrorResponse`, the message `Http failure response for …: 410`, or `Object captured as exception` with HTTP fields) and the status is **0–499**, it is dropped.

| Status        | Meaning                                | Dropped?            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0             | No response (offline, CORS, cancelled) | Yes                 |
| 401, 403      | Not signed in / not allowed            | Yes                 |
| 404, 410      | Missing or deleted resource            | Yes                 |
| 409, 422, 429 | Conflict, validation, rate limit       | Yes                 |
| Other 4xx     | Client/request errors                  | Yes                 |
| 500–599       | Server error                           | **No — still sent** |

This includes noisy issues such as `Http failure response for https://api.osf.io/v2/users/…: 410` and `Object captured as exception with keys: error, headers, … status … url` when the status is below 500.

**Side effect:** a 4xx that is actually a frontend bug is also dropped (for example a request URL that contains `undefined`).

## What still goes to Sentry

- HTTP 500–599
- TypeError / ReferenceError / other exceptions that are not in the ignore list and have no HTTP status
- HTTP-looking events where a status cannot be read

## Changing the filters

1. Open `src/app/core/helpers/sentry-filter.helper.ts`.
2. Add a **string** to `SENTRY_IGNORE_ERRORS` for a stable message substring, or a **RegExp** for a pattern.
3. Add to `SENTRY_DENY_URLS` only for third-party script origins.
4. Change `sentryBeforeSend` only if the HTTP status rule should change (for example keep 404s that contain `undefined` in the URL).

After a release, confirm in the Sentry project that volume dropped and that 5xx / real exceptions still appear.
